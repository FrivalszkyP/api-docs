		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>The Ustream Player SDK lets you play Ustream live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the native SDK gives you full control over the Player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.</p>
		<p class="note">If you need none of the above, you may use the HTML-based <a href="../player-api/index.html">Player API</a> instead</p>
